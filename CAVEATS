- Parts of the program assume that read and write nodes have only one end, for
  simplicity.

- The UI for choice of non-deterministic alternates isn't very intuitive, and
  currently cannot choose alternates in ticks where there are no nodes.

- The animation of components is sometimes wrong, timing-wise. The animation
  assumes that data arrives at all of the output ports at the moment there is
  data on one of the input ports. See the lossyChooser (#debug-lossyChooser and
  #debug-component) for an example where this assumption is not met.

  The right way to do it would probably be to consider pending data items
  inside components on a step-by-step basis, rather than just looking at the
  final coloring. For the example connector in the Playground (Or-selector),
  this doesn't matter.

- Filters and other data-dependent channels aren't supported. All data items
  are considered identical (since the program only keeps track of on which ends
  there are pending data items).
